# Arithmetic Progression Checker
This program will take a set of sequential, contiguous integers [n, n + 1, ..., k - 1, k], split the set into two for each 
(non-redundant) palindromic partition scheme, and check the two partitions of each for an arithmetic progression
in at least four terms. The partitions of the schemes without an arithmetic progression in either partition, if 
any, are then returned.
